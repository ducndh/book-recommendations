                <h3>Plot Overview</h3>
                <p> The play begins with the brief appearance of a trio of witches and then moves to a military camp,
                    where the Scottish King Duncan hears the news that his generals, Macbeth and Banquo, have defeated
                    two separate invading armies—one from Ireland, led by the rebel Macdonwald, and one from Norway.
                    Following their pitched battle with these enemy forces, Macbeth and Banquo encounter the witches as
                    they cross a moor. </p>
                <img class="image" src="macbeth.jpg">
                <p> The witches prophesy that Macbeth will be made thane (a rank of Scottish
                    nobility) of Cawdor and eventually King of Scotland. They also prophesy that Macbeth’s companion,
                    Banquo, will beget a line of Scottish kings, although Banquo will never be king himself. The witches
                    vanish, and Macbeth and Banquo treat their prophecies skeptically until some of King Duncan’s men
                    come to thank the two generals for their victories in battle and to tell Macbeth that he has indeed
                    been named thane of Cawdor. </p>
